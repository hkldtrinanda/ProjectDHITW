This project was developed by lecturers from the Jakarta Creative Media State Polytechnic (Politeknik Negeri Media Kreatif Jakarta) with the aim of equipping students from the Faculty of Graphic Engineering (Teknik Grafika) with the knowledge of any hazards that exist in the workplace, especially in printing laboratories, warehouses, and other workplaces. Cemong Studio got the opportunity to do a collab work with the other Polimedia gamedev representative to develop this game!
